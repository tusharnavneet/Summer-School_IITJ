3. NAVIGATION STRUCTURE:

My navigation structure uses an unordered list (<ul>) with list items (<li>) containing anchor (<a>) elements.
This is a common and accessible pattern for creating navigation menus.

The navigation is placed in the <header> element on each page, ensuring consistency across the three pages:
- portfolio.html (main portfolio page displaying my skills, education, and projects)
- about.html (detailed information about me, my projects, and achievements)
- contact.html (contact form and direct contact information)

The navigation allows visitors to easily move between all pages of the website.
Additional internal links on the about page connect back to the portfolio page, while external links
point to my professional profiles on GitHub, LeetCode, and GeeksforGeeks.

In the footer section, I've included my email and phone number for direct contact options
on every page, ensuring visitors can reach out regardless of which page they're viewing.
